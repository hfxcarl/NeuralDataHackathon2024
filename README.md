Grapth Theory - Systems Segregation


### data

The data folder contains both metadata and timeseries data:
 - */clean_healthy_ts/* direcory contains timeseries for 296 participants. Each timeseries is 196x200 matrix. The 196 corresponding to the functional run length (~10mins @TR=3sec) and 200-nodes from [Schaefer Parcellation Atlas](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal).
   Note that there are two sessions per subject. Getting started I recommend using ses-1. To add more power in classification accuracy the two sessions can either be concatenated (ie, 392x200) prior to calculating correlation coefficients, or simply take the average after of both session correlation coefficients.
 - */test_ts/* directory contains a single timeseries (196x200) for code examples and testing of matlab and python system_segregation.
 - *Schaefer2018_200Parcels_7Networks_order_FSLMNI152_1mm_Centroid_RAS.csv* file contains the 200-node atlas information including x,y,z centroid coordinates and network_membership of each node. 
 - *network_members.csv* (aka: "M.txt") file contains the vector (1x200) labelling the network membership for each of the 200 nodes.
 - *participants_with_data_296.csv* file contains information about each participant, including age, agegroup, yrs_education, cognitive-behaviour test scores, etc.
 - *participants_Spreng.xlsx* file contains participant phenotypic behavioural & cognitive values
 - *Spreng_info_datadbehav_README_updated_20230530.docx* contains descriptions of the behavioural & cognitive variables


### tools

The tools folder contains Matlab libraries for BCT and systems-segregation, downloaded and installed from their respective sources. Including licenses, etc.
- [BCT](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/)
- [systems-segregation-and-graph-tools]( https://github.com/mychan24/system-segregation-and-graph-tools) 


### code

#### Python:
  - segregation.py file contains the segregation() code duplicating the functionality of original Matlab code (see above). There are two functions: segregate() and test().

#### Matlab:
  - seg_test_matlab.m file contains a very simple example of loading a timeseries and calculating correlation coefficients, zscoring and thresholding these, then running the system-segregation function. 
  - systems_seg_example.m file contains a longer example of loading all ses-1 timeseries, calculating correlation coefficients, zscoring and thresholding, running system-segregation.
